Description: Uses the rNOMADS package to download NOAA GEFS 6-hr weather forecasts for a set point locations defined by their latitude and longitude.  Temporally downscales the 6-hr to 1-hr (default) using a spline (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed), solar geometry (shortwave radiation), and constant (precipitation, longwave radiation) functions.  Saves files as netcdf using a prescribed directory structure generated within the `output_directory`.
